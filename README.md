## Hi there 👋

I'm **Bulali ** — a C# / .NET developer who’s been building cool stuff for about 3 years.  
I write code, fix bugs, break things, and then fix them again 😄  
Also a *gamer* and *anime lover*, so if I’m not coding, I’m probably grinding XP somewhere or binge-watching another season I swore I'd watch “later”.
